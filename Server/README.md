# TechTests Server

The server's primary purpose is to host a web app. It has to be written in NodeJS
using the express framework, and should be able to properly authenticate users.

Obviously, for any functionality in the client side, the corresponding server side
code must be present and functional.

The database used for storing and evaluating tests would be MongoDB.
